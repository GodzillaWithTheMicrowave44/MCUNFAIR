# MCUNFAIR
A Minecraft mod that intends to make Minecraft more challenging yet less tedious.

# The Vision

My goal with this project is to make changes that mojang are hesitent to, the motivation comes from playing minecraft with some buddies. Every year or so we get addicted again and play non stop for about a month, but it becomes stale quickly. I think its because we always get caught up into the meta (make a pillager farm, villager breeder/tradeing hall, iron farm etc) Its always the same. In the end i hope to have a mod that will shift the metas around and balance the stradegies to beat the game. 

# Planned Changes

1. Balancing irons farms. Iron is important and a lot of it is used for many things, But getting a chest worth of iron before entering a mine is too OP. Thinking of solutions.
2. Aquiring Totems. They are too easy to get, i think the appropiate change is to make them a lot rarer.
3. Smithing templates shouldnt be so tedious to get. Increase spawn chance in all bastion chests and make at least one chest in each bastion 100% spawn chance.
4. Enchanted books should be harder to get from villagers.
5. Add 2 more difficulties. Expert and Unfair. Mobs are harder.
6. Enderdragon is way to easy, along with the dungeon.
7. 5 min to find your loot is too short, esspecially since caves can go a lot deeper now. Increase despawn time and renamed items dont despawn just like mobs. (should be disabled on large servers due to lag exploits)
8.
