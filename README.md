# MCUNFAIR
A Minecraft mod that intends to make Minecraft more challenging yet less tedious.

# The Vision

My goal with this project is to make changes that mojang are hesitent to, the motivation comes from playing minecraft with some buddies. Every year or so we get addicted again and play non stop for about a month, but it becomes stale quickly. I think its because we always get caught up into the meta (make a pillager farm, villager breeder/tradeing hall, iron farm etc) Its always the same. In the end i hope to have a mod that will shift the metas around and balance the stradegies to beat the game.
